# RatTracker: A software platform for the Conditioned place preference test 
Conditioned place preference (CPP) is a form of Pavlovian conditioning used to measure the motivational effects of objects or experiences. By measuring the amount of time an animal spends in an area that has been associated with a stimulus, researchers can infer the animal's liking for the stimulus. <br/>
One of the challenges is calculation the time; manual measuring is too hard and some times impossible because in every simple research, there are about one hundred tests at least. So a platform for measuring this time with the help of computer vision can help researchers dramatically. In this project, we decide to develop a software platform that can automatically detect areas and measure the time spent in each of them. In this project, we use the techniques learned in computer vision course to develop a platform to identify the areas and the time that rats spent in each area. It identifies areas irrespective of angle, size, or number, and then by detecting rats and tracking them reports the time of presence in each area with 3 milliseconds accuracy.
